      <h3>Ethics Check: AI and Academic Research</h3>

      </p>

      <div class="full-article" id="article1">
        <p>
AI is a powerful research assistant, but it's not infallible. Truth matters—not just because grades depend on accuracy, but because integrity is foundational to everything I do as a student and future business professional.
Walking in Integrity
Proverbs 10:9 says, "Whoever walks in integrity walks securely, but whoever takes crooked paths will be found out." This verse reminds me that shortcuts always catch up with you. When AI generates a citation that looks legitimate or summarizes research that sounds authoritative, it's tempting to take it at face value. But integrity means doing the hard work of verification, even when no one's watching.
I've seen AI confidently cite studies that don't exist or misrepresent what a source actually says. If I submit that false information in a paper, I'm not walking in integrity—I'm taking a crooked path. The security that comes from walking in integrity isn't just about avoiding consequences. It's about building a foundation of truthfulness that will serve me throughout my career.
The Real Risk and My Commitment
The biggest risk I face is accidentally submitting false information because I trusted AI without verification. AI can hallucinate sources, misattribute quotes, or present outdated data as current. In an academic setting, this could mean failing an assignment or, worse, undermining my credibility with professors and peers.
Here's my practical mitigation: I will cross-check every source AI provides. That means locating the actual article or book, reading the relevant section myself, and confirming the information matches what AI claimed. If I can't verify it, I won't use it. It's that simple.
Truth in Daily Work
This isn't just about getting good grades. It's about forming habits that honor God. Every time I verify a source instead of taking a shortcut, I'm practicing integrity. When I eventually enter the business world, these same habits will protect me from misrepresenting data to clients or making decisions based on faulty information. Truth-telling starts in the small things—like checking footnotes in a college paper.

      <h3>Ethics Check: AI and Privacy in Business</h3>

      </p>

      <div class="full-article" id="article1">
        <p>
When I use AI for business tasks, I'm going to be working with sensitive information—financial data, customer details, employee records. AI can help me analyze patterns or draft communications faster, but I won't sacrifice someone else's privacy for convenience. My position is simple: I will never include personal details about someone who isn't me without their permission, and when I do use AI, I'll anonymize data whenever possible.
Treating Others as I Want to Be Treated
Matthew 7:12 says, "So in everything, do to others what you would have them do to you." This is the Golden Rule, and it's the foundation of how I think about privacy. If someone had my financial information or employment records, I wouldn't want them feeding it into an AI system without asking me first. I'd want them to protect what's mine, to handle it carefully, and to respect the trust I placed in them.
When a customer shares their payment information or an employee trusts me with personal data, they're not consenting to that information being used as training data for an AI model. They're trusting me to handle it responsibly. The Golden Rule means I treat their information the way I'd want mine treated—with care, discretion, and respect.
The Real Risk and My Commitment
The risk here is serious: I could expose private information to AI systems that store, analyze, or even share data in ways I can't control. A customer's credit card number, an employee's salary details, or proprietary financial data could end up compromised. Even if it seems unlikely, the potential harm to real people is too high to ignore.
Here's my practical mitigation: I will never include personal details about anyone else in an AI prompt. If I need AI assistance with data analysis or communication, I'll anonymize the information first—removing names, account numbers, and identifying details. When anonymization isn't possible or appropriate, I'll ask for explicit permission before using AI. And if someone says no, that's the end of the conversation. Their data stays private.
Loving My Neighbor in Practice
This commitment isn't just about avoiding legal trouble or protecting my reputation. It's about loving my neighbor. Every piece of data represents a real person who deserves dignity and respect. When I choose to protect their privacy, even when it's inconvenient, I'm living out the Golden Rule in my daily work. That's the kind of business professional I want to be.

      <div class="full-article" id="article1">
        <p>
Artificial Intelligence has become an important tool in today’s workplaces, offering new ways to communicate, organize, and create. In my future vocation in business, I believe AI can be used responsibly to improve writing, strengthen communication, and complete tasks more effectively. When used correctly, it has the potential to make work more efficient and even more creative. However, the ethical use of AI depends on how it is viewed and applied.
My position is that AI should be used as a tool for growth, not as a replacement for personal effort or creativity. In business, writing and communication are central to building trust and leading others well. AI can help improve the clarity of reports, refine speeches, and assist in professional correspondence. When used this way, it becomes a resource that helps a person steward their gifts more wisely. 1 Peter 4:10 says, “Each of you should use whatever gift you have received to serve others, as faithful stewards of God’s grace in its various forms.” This verse reminds me that the skills and tools I have are not meant for my own advantage, but to serve others well. Using AI as a tool to strengthen my work can be one way to do that faithfully.
One of the biggest risks of using AI is becoming dependent on it and losing the ability to think creatively or critically. If I rely too heavily on AI to generate ideas or make decisions, my work will lose its authenticity and personal insight. To avoid this, I plan to use AI as a way to spark new ideas rather than to replace my own thinking. I will continue to review, revise, and shape my work through my own understanding and discernment.
When approached with humility and discernment, AI can be a meaningful part of vocation. It can help believers work more effectively while still honoring God through careful stewardship and thoughtful service to others.
