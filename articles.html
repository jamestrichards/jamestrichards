      <h3>My Position on AI in Business</h3>
      <p>
AI has become a crucial tool in the business world, and I believe it can be used effectively to assist in completing everyday tasks like writing emails, drafting reports, and designing websites. However, AI should be used as a tool to enhance human work rather than replace human judgment and creativity. My position is that AI can benefit businesses when used responsibly, but it requires clear boundaries and intentional stewardship to avoid the risks that come with relying too heavily on technology.
Biblical Lens: Stewardship
The principle of stewardship guides my approach to using AI in business. In the parable of the talents found in Matthew 25:14-30, Jesus teaches about the responsibility to use the resources God has given us wisely and productively. AI is a resource that can help us work more efficiently and accomplish tasks that would otherwise take much longer. As a Christian in the business world, I believe God calls me to steward this technology well by using it to serve others and create value, while also recognizing the limitations and potential dangers of AI. Stewardship means using AI to multiply my efforts without compromising integrity or displacing the human element that makes business relationships meaningful.
Application to Business
Currently, I use AI to design a personal website. AI helps me generate ideas, refine content, and solve technical problems more quickly than I could on my own. By using AI as an assistant rather than a replacement, I can work more efficiently while maintaining the personal touch that builds trust in business.
Risk and Mitigation
One major risk of AI in business is job displacement. As AI becomes more capable of completing tasks that humans traditionally performed, there is a real concern that businesses will replace workers with AI to cut costs. This creates problems, especially when companies prioritize profit over people. Another risk is misinformation; AI can generate content that sounds convincing but contains errors or biased information, which can damage a business's reputation if not carefully reviewed.
To reduce these risks, I plan to use AI as a tool to enhance my work rather than replace human workers or skip the review process. I will fact-check AI-generated content and verify sources before using information in professional settings. Additionally, I think advocating for businesses to use AI in ways that support employees rather than displace them, such as automating repetitive tasks so workers can focus on more meaningful and creative work.

      <h3>AI and Academic Research</h3>
      <p>
AI is a powerful research assistant, but it's not infallible. When I use AI to help with academic research this term, I'm committing to verify every claim before I cite it. Truth matters—not just because grades depend on accuracy, but because integrity is foundational to everything I do as a student and future business professional.
Walking in Integrity
Proverbs 10:9 says, "Whoever walks in integrity walks securely, but whoever takes crooked paths will be found out." This verse reminds me that shortcuts always catch up with you. When AI generates a citation that looks legitimate or summarizes research that sounds authoritative, it's tempting to take it at face value. But integrity means doing the hard work of verification, even when no one's watching.
I've seen AI confidently cite studies that don't exist or misrepresent what a source actually says. If I submit that false information in a paper, I'm not walking in integrity—I'm taking a crooked path. The security that comes from walking in integrity isn't just about avoiding consequences. It's about building a foundation of truthfulness that will serve me throughout my career.
The Real Risk and My Commitment
The biggest risk I face is accidentally submitting false information because I trusted AI without verification. AI can hallucinate sources, misattribute quotes, or present outdated data as current. In an academic setting, this could mean failing an assignment or, worse, undermining my credibility with professors and peers.
Here's my practical mitigation: I will cross-check every source AI provides. That means locating the actual article or book, reading the relevant section myself, and confirming the information matches what AI claimed. If I can't verify it, I won't use it. It's that simple.
Truth in Daily Work
This isn't just about getting good grades. It's about forming habits that honor God. Every time I verify a source instead of taking a shortcut, I'm practicing integrity. When I eventually enter the business world, these same habits will protect me from misrepresenting data to clients or making decisions based on faulty information. Truth-telling starts in the small things—like checking footnotes in a college paper.

      <h3>Faith Over Fear</h3>
      <p>
        When we face challenges, fear can easily take hold — but faith reminds us that  
        the battle is not ours, it belongs to the Lord.
