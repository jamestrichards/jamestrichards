    <h2>Journey Overview</h2>
    <p>I began playing basketball at a young age, developing a love for the game that continues to this day. My journey has been guided by faith and perseverance — from community gyms in Williston to the courts of Trinity Bible College. Every moment, from early mornings to late-night practices, has taught me valuable lessons about leadership, commitment, and teamwork.</p>
